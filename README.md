Threading Examples in C++ and Java

This project demonstrates various threading concepts including mutexes, semaphores, and thread pools.

## Examples

### 1. Basic Threading (`threading.cpp`)
A basic C++ example demonstrating:
- Mutex synchronization for console output
- Binary semaphores for thread signaling
- Thread pool implementation for task processing

### 2. Threading with Random Numbers (`thread_numbers.cpp`)
An extended C++ version that adds:
- Random number generation per thread
- Thread initialization synchronization
- Parent thread notification of child thread startup
- Display of thread-specific random numbers alongside output

### 3. Java Threading with Random Numbers (`ThreadingNumbers.java`)
A Java implementation of the random numbers example that demonstrates:
- Java's ReentrantLock for mutex functionality
- Semaphores for thread signaling
- Custom thread pool implementation
- Thread-safe random number generation and tracking
- Condition variables for thread synchronization

## Requirements

For C++ examples:
- C++20 or later
- A modern C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

For Java example:
- Java 11 or later
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Compilation

To compile the C++ basic threading example:
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 threading.cpp -o threading -pthread
```

To compile the C++ random numbers threading example:
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 thread_numbers.cpp -o thread_numbers -pthread
```

To compile the Java version:
```bash
javac ThreadingNumbers.java
```

## Running the Applications

Run the C++ basic threading example:
```bash
./threading
```

Run the C++ threading with random numbers example:
```bash
./thread_numbers
```

Run the Java version:
```bash
java ThreadingNumbers
```

The programs will demonstrate different threading concepts by:
1. Using mutexes/locks to synchronize console output
2. Using semaphores for thread signaling
3. Implementing a thread pool to process multiple tasks

The random number versions (`thread_numbers` and `ThreadingNumbers`) will additionally show:
- Random numbers generated by each thread at startup
- Thread IDs and their associated random numbers
- A summary of all thread pool worker random numbers
